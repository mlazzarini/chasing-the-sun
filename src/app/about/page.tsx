        Hi! We are Margherita and Fabio. We decided to leave our jobs for one
        year and travelling around the world.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Margherita (Maggie), born and raised in Italy, is a software developer
        with 7 years of experience. Since 2018 she is living and working in
        Switzerland. Fabio is a quality engineer working in the automotive
        sector. He is born, raised and living in Zurich.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Both in love with travelling, we decided that we needed a break from
        work, so we picked (some) countries around the world that we always
        wanted to visit, and weâ€™ll try to explore as much as possible.
      </p>
