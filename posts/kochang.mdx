Ko Chang (the one on the west part of Thailand) is the 3rd biggest thai island. To get there we flew to Trat from Bangkok with a very short flight, and then we hopped on a speedboat for a 30 minutes ride. We booked a whole house on the east side of the island, the quiet one. Indeed it was quiet, except for the noisy birds squeaking even during the night üòÖ

We rented two scooters to go around, and I have to say roads are not easy. Many of them are very steep and with tight curves. However, both Claudia and Fabio were two excellent drivers.

Our favourite spot on the island was probably White Sand beach. As the name may suggest, the sand is white, the water is crystal clear, and a lot of palm trees are shading the beach. There are even some swings on the water, creating perfect Insta photo spots. It was not even too crowded, being the beginning of the high season.

Another nice beach we liked was Lonely beach: with a reputation for late night parties and vodka buckets drinkers, we had a nice "day time" over there. Very good drinks on the beach at sunset ‚ù§Ô∏è

One day we decided to go on a boat trip to explore nearby smaller islands, and snorkelling spots. The snorkelling was nothing exceptional, but we were taken to a very beautiful beach on Ko Laoya and the views from the boat were also rewarding.

We stayed 5 nights in Ko Chang. We decided to move then to another smaller island, Ko Mak, for the next 3 days.
