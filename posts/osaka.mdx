Our last destination in Japan was Osaka: it is located not far away from Kyoto, but it looks completely different. It is more loud, chaotic and messy compared to the other japanese cities that we have seen. The only "sightseeing" activity that we did here was going to the Osaka castle that is located in the city. It is very old, but it was rebuild 3 times - or at least some of its parts - as it was affected first from a lightnening, from a fire and finally from Second World War bombs. The history is very impressing, and from the top of it there is a nice view on the city.

Other than that, we visited Nara, which is only 40 mins away from Osaka with the train. The Nara parks hosts many wild deers, that get feed by tourists buying "deer crackers" from the street stands. They are very cute, but I have to be honest: the area stinks 😄. We went to visit the famous Tōdai-ji temple that hosts a 16 metres high bronze statue of Buddha: very impressive.

Our main activity in Osaka was eating though 😄. We tried the local specialities: the takoyaki, deep fried balls filled with octopus, and the okonomiyaki, a japanese style "pizza", whose base is made with kale and eggs, and that gets topped with a big mix of fish, meat, cheese and sauces. We liked both, but they are very heavy 😅. Other than that, we had a lot of sushi and wagyu beef "yakiniku", where you can typically grill meat by yourself on a small grill installed on your table.
