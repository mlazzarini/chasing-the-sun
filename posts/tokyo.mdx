Tokyo was... shocking ðŸ˜… First, we flew with All Nippon Airways and the plane covered with Pokemon pictures. The name of the plane model was something like Pikachu Boeing... The urban area of the city is huge, probably the biggest city we have ever been. The temperature was extremely hot and humid: we knew that we were coming to Japan when it was not high season due to the heat, but this year is particularly hot, and this made it quite a challenge to do sightseeing during the day. We visited the Meiji Shrine in Harakuju, that was a short walk from our hotel, and in the following days the Royal Palace, which we found a bit disappointing as the palace itself was not visible even from outside, because of the police security around it. We also went on top of the Tokyo tower (only til 150 meters), and visited the temple close by, Zojo-ji, which we found very nice.

The best in Tokyo was the food. We were surprised how much good and cheap food you can find, especially in the area from our hotel (Shibuya). We had many ramen: the classic is the one that you pay from a vending machine right at the entrance of the restaurant. After paying, you can sit inside and wait for your order. One afternoon we joined a food tour from <LinkComponent href="https://www.secretfoodtours.com/tokyo/food-tours-tokyo/" text="Secret Food Tours" />: Natsumi took us around the district of Ueno, where we could learn a lot, from the correct way of eating the sushi, to many aspects of the japanese culture. Another highlight from our food experience was definitely the Wagyu and Kobe beef, that we liked a lot.

On another afternoon, we visited the interactive museum teamLab Planets in Toyosu. It was a unique and full immersive experience, where you go around several rooms with digital and physical artworks, without shoes, sometimes walking in water ðŸ˜„. It was visually very impressive, and we would definitely recommend to see it.

Another activity that you can't miss in Tokyo is the gaming, especially in the manga district (Akihabara). Walking around the streets of this area, you see several video game halls, on multiple floors, with any kind of videogame, vending machine, photoboot and whatsoever. Of course, our favorite floor was the "Vintage videogames" section ðŸ¤£
