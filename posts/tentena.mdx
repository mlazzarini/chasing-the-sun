After the beauty of the Togean island, we made our way through the southern part of Sulawesi. After a relatively short ride on a speed boat, we reached the main island at the port of Ampana and drove right after to Tentena, a small town on the Poso Lake - the 3rd largest lake in Sulawesi. Our accomodation was directly on the lake, with a sandy beach in front, and a view that actually looks more like a sea view ðŸ˜…

One our first day we rented a scooter a drove to the Saluopa waterfalls, where we could "swim" (it would be better to say "dip our body") after a very short and easy walk through the forest. In the afternoon we drove to the center of Tentena, that is known for eel fishing from the river. From the main bridge, where the river connects to the lake, it is possible to spot the V-shaped eel traps. This animal can reach til 2 meters lenght ðŸ˜³

On the next day we were taken to spot the megaliths in Bada valley, a 2-3 hours drive from our accomodation. Our guide, Alfie, has more than 30 years of experience, and it was really a pleasure to have him as a tour guide. Most of these heavy pieces of stone were discovered in the last century (actually one was just discovered 3 years ago), and belong to an ancient era that is still unknown to archeologists. The stone could be found only in the south part of Sulawesi, not in this valley, and must have been carried for hundreds of kilometers, using only rudimental instruments. The carving is also very accurate, and must have been done with very simple tools. Some of the megaliths represent humans - both female and male, some others look like animals. The biggest is 4 meters tall. It was really fascinating to have the chance to see and touch something so mysterious and so antique. Moreover, the walks to reach the megaliths were in a spectacular scenery between green rice fields.
