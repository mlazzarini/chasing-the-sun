Ben Tre was the first chosen destination in the Mekong Delta area as it didn’t look too touristic, and we were very happy about our choice. We stayed a bit outside of the center, in an absolutely lovely hotel that we would 100% recommend: <LinkComponent href="https://www.booking.com/hotel/vn/lavilla-de-coco-ben-tre.en-gb.html" text="la Villa de Coco" />. The hotel has a great garden and pool, everything was new, and the room was big and cozy. The food served was also delicious. We stayed only 2 nights, as Ben Tre is small, and doesn’t have so much to offer, so one full day was enough to see a lot from this area. We could go around using the bikes provided by the hotel. We went on a boat tour on the Mekong river and we visited a couple of fish farms. We had the chance to try out the water coconut, a fruit that grows in the river water: the taste was something between coconut and lychee, very interesting. The water from the river makes the soil of this region very rich, which is why this area is full of fruit trees, especially coconut. Cacao is also grown here, and we could try one fruit: the beans are sent to be industrially processed, but the pulp of the fruit can be eaten raw.
