Hanoi, capital of Vietnam: we made a long stop here, and it was so nice. The food is a highlight: our absolute favorite was "bun cha",  grilled pork meat in a soup with cold rice noodles and fresh mint and basil leaves. We tried so many of these around the city, included the famous place visited by Obama when he was president: after his visit, they renamed the restaurant “Obama Bun Cha”, they are very proud of it 😅 It is very interesting how Vietnamese people doesn't seem to bear any grudges caused by the Vietnam war (for them the was is called “American war” by the way).

Another thing we liked a lot was "bahn cuon", dumplings made with a wetty rice paper wrapping a mix of mushrooms and pork meat. And the unmissable classic ones: "bahn mi" (baguette sandwich with a meaty filling) and "pho bo/ga" (meaty broth soup with beef or chicken meat and rice noodles). We tried also "nom thit bo kho": a salad with fresh herbs and dry beef and pork meat (this was not our favorite as the meat was very chewy).

A sweet and pleasant discovery was the egg coffee (or hot chocolate): coffee topped with a whipped cream made with egg and condensed milk. It tastes like a tiramisu but without the heaviness of the mascarpone. In general, the Vietnamese coffee is very good: the classic one is made mixing coffee, condensed milk and ice. Very sweet but very very good, I loved to have one every morning! Unfortunately Fabio doesn’t like coffee so he can’t appreciate. However, we could enjoy together the several "bia hoi" places that offer local-made craft beer. This beer is very light and refreshing, perfect for hot weather, and also extremely cheap: the most expensive that we had was around 50 cent dollars/euros.

Vietnamese people are famous for eating also very exotic and strange stuff 😅 We didn't dare to try the snails, that are very famous in this part of Vietnam. However, we did a food tour with a local guide and she made us try a salty "worm cake" 🤣 It had really a little of these insects inside, together with many other "normal" ingredients, and honestly it was good. By the way, Mia was a very good <LinkComponent text="tour guide" href="https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Attraction_Review-g293924-d5583955-Reviews-Hanoi_Street_Food_Tour-Hanoi.html" /> that we would definitely recommend.

We slept in a super nice <LinkComponent href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1036201658328417723" text="Airbnb apartment" />, very close to the Old Quarter, but not too much into the traffic. The apartment was really in the middle of a group of apartments of Vietnamese local people and it was cool to have a look around 😄

Moreover, we visited the Ngoc Son Temple on the lake, the Long Bien bridge, and the Ho Chi Min mausoleum, where the body of the ex president is preserved and open to visitors. Unfortunately when we were there it was closed to the public, but we could watch the changing of the guard (similar to the British one).
