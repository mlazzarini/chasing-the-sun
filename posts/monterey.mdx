We spent one day in Monterey and surroundings: Monterey is a fancy village on the coast, with plenty of restaurants and shops. It is famous for its aquarium, so we decided to visited and it was (expensive but) totally worth it. It is huge, and we spent more than 3 hours inside without realising that the time was flying... The cutest are the sea otters, that can chill in a tank with water and a small "rocky beach". They are rescued, and they stay in the aquarium only a limited time, until it is safe to release them into the wild again. The penguins instead are born and raised in an artificial environment (as part of a program that preserves animal species at risk of extinction). The big tank with hammerhead sharks, giant turtles and yellow fin tunas was also very impressive. But the most spectacular to watch are the colorful jellyfish tanks.

After the aquarium we wandered around the coastline in Monterey, then we drove on Ocean Road and along a road called "17 miles drive", both with spectacular views of the coast. We wanted to check out also Carmel Beach, but we could not find a parking spot. This week it was not so easy to find accomodations in general, as many americans were on vacation as well because of the 4th of July. Unfortunately we could not stop at the beach, but we had a very nice driving day towards south, in the direction of our next destination: Big Sur.
