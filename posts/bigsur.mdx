Big Sur offered the best views we had in California: we slept only a couple days here as almost everything was fully booked and ultra overpriced - because of 4th of July. But even if the time was short, we could have many beautiful views on the ocean and nice walks. Luckily, the best views are reachable with short hikes, and the highlights of the area are all at a short distance between each other.

First we visited Point Lobos State Natural Reserve on a recommendation by Josefin (thank you! ❤️), walking along the short but beautiful Cypress Grove Trail. Then we drove through the Bixby Bridge: built in 1932 and still one of the tallest bridges in the world.

On the next day first we visited the McWay Falls: waterfalls falling on the beach, one of the most iconic views of California. Unfortunately a big part of the trail to get to the waterfalls is closed due to a damage (and apparently the government is not investing on maintenance of National Parks), but we could anyway get a nice picture. We then walked along the Buzzards Roost Trail - but starting from our motel, making it slightly longer. This trail leads to a viewpoint of the coast and has a quite intense elevation for half of it, but it is almost always shaded. And at last we walked along the short Partington Cove Trail, that leads to a small rocky beach and a viewpoint of the coast.
