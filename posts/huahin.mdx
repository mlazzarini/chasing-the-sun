We flew to Hua Hin with a short flight from Chiang Mai, really hoping this is the last flight we take before the very end of the trip ðŸ˜„ Ideally we would have gone directly to Ko Phayam, our next destination, but we should have taken two flights (one to Bangkok, and one to Ranong), and the price was very expensive. So we opted for a cheap flight to a destination that was new to both of us. I have to admit that Hua Hin was not our favourite, and we would not go back there again. The vibe of the city is not really nice: a lot of couples in their retirement time, and families with kids, a couple of big malls and very simple and touristic bars/restaurants/entertainment in general. However, we spent there only 3 nights, and we made the most out of it, treating ourselves with delicious seafood, going to the gym, and strolling around the streets and beaches.

We happened to be in Hua Hin during Chinese New Year celebrations. The "gifts to the gods" (food and drinks placed close to the small shrines) around the city were richer than usual, we could hear firecrackers bursting around the city, and a huge dragon was marching inside every building of every street as a wish for good luck.

The hightlight of Hua Hin was probably the seafood. Every night the night market street gets full of stalls selling typical asian street food, and in the same road you can find some seafood restaurants that are showcasing the fresh fish that they have on the street. We were attracted by fatty lobsters and huge prawns, and it was actually tasting very good. We went to a couple of these restaurants, and once we had grilled lobster, another time prawns and fish, and we found everything delicious.

On our first day we strolled around, not too far from the main center of Hua Hin and our hotel, just walking. On our second day, we rented a scooter - that was very hard to find, as many shops were closed because of Chinese New Year's celebrations - and drove further south, to reach Khao Takiab beach. We climbed to the top of the hill, overlooking the long stretch of beach. We could not sit and chill on the beach, as it was very windy, but the view from the top was nice.
