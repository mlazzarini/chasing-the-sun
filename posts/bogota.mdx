We spent only one full day in BogotÃ¡: the 1st of May. We woke up early (jet lag ðŸ˜‡) and went to the Monserrate viewpoint with the cable car, where you can see how incredibly huge is the city from there... It is also possible to hike up there, but we didn't feel like working out. At the top, there is a church and some food/souvenir shops where they called me out "Swedish" - guess I have to work hard on my Italian tan. On the way down, we found out that you can buy aphrodisiac "big ass ants" ("hormigas culonas"): this time we skipped it, but maybe next time we give it a try ðŸ˜….

I wanted to visit the Botero museum or do the graffiti tour as recommended by a very good friend of mine, but almost everything was closed because of the 1st of May celebrations. So we joined the huge and loud celebrations, walking til Plaza de Bolivar. I had the chance to see that lamas are also welcome to the celebration, all dressed up for the special occasion ðŸ˜…. In the afternoon the sky was clear, and we could chill in the sun.

Next day, we're heading to the Caribbean coast to Santa Marta, to meet a good friend from Fabio who moved to Colombia a few years back. Looking forward to lay in the sun and get my usual sunburn, as I am white like a ghost at the moment ðŸ‘».
