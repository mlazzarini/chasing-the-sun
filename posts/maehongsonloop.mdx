We flew from Kuala Lumpur to Chiang Mai, in the north of Thailand. In the following days with hit the road in the direction of villages in the north of Thailand, to complete the Mae Hong Son loop, 600km of scenic road that includes 1,864 curves and goes through forests and rice rice fields. We wanted to start the loop as soon as possible, as at the beginning of February farmers start to burn rice crops, and the air becomes unbreathable. On top of that, the visibility is very limited, so definitely not the best for a motorbike tour on a mountain region üòÖ

We had a couple of days in Chiang Mai to find a motorbike to rent and pack our stuff, as we didn‚Äôt hit the road with our big 17kg backpacks, but only with a smaller bag each. We were lucky to find a scooter available, as it looked like everything was going sold out. In 2 different shops, their last motorbike was just rented in front of our eyes üòÖ but we ended up with a Honda 150cc without any support for the backpacks, so not bad.

## **Day 1**
We decided to tackle the loop clockwise, in order to leave the best part for the end. So no surprise that on the first day the road was not spectacular, but a rather straight large road, with a few golden temple here and there. We stopped at a food stall on the road for lunch, where we had one of the best khao soi soup ever for a ridicoulous price, then we proceeded in the direction of our first destination: Mae Sariang, a small village on a river.

We arrived at our guesthouse overlooking corn and rice fields in the afternoon, and then we headed to a bar with a view on the river to have a beer in the sun. In the north the temperature was way lower than in the southern part of Thailand: during the day in the sun was hot and pleasant, but in the night it was falling under 15 degrees.

## **Day 2**
We woke up in the middle of misty corn fields, and after a night with a few hours of sleep - we had a noisy neighbor ü•≤ - we headed to Mae Sariang ‚Äúcenter‚Äù for breakfast. We found a classic Thai soup restaurant and we had a warm noodle soup with pork meat. With our stomachs filled up, we started driving nord, in the direction of our next destination.

On the way, we visited the Wat To Phae temple on the Yuam river, that during WWII was used as a military hospital for wounded Japanese soldiers. We found this out in the Thai-Japan Friendship Memorial, where we learnt that this area was occupied by Japanese soldiers as a base to fight in Myanmar against the British. Our last stop of the day was at a caf√®/viewpoint, then we reached our guesthouse for the night. We booked a simple room in the middle of a beautiful garden, a little outside of Mae Hong Son, the biggest center in this region of Thailand. It is very close to the Myanmar border and it has been historically a strategic point for connections with the neighboring country. For dinner, we went to a restaurant cooking burmese dishes, where we had a delicious khao soi - the signature dish in the north of Thailand - and burmese salad.

## **Day 3**
We kicked off our morning with a soup at the morning market of Mae Hong Son. We then drove to ‚Ä¶ village, where Karen together other ethnic groups live. These women are known for their heavy bronze rings tied around their neck. Normally we don‚Äôt like visiting villages just to look at the people living there, but in this case you must pay a fee to go there, that will be invested in the communities living in the area. We also bought some local-made bronze jewelry and donated some money volountarily, hoping to support the population, rather than an invasive form of tourism.

We then went to visit the impressive Wat Phu Samaraman temple, with a long bamboo and wood bridge that was built by villagers to allow monks to cross the rice paddies between the town and monastery more easily, and a beautiful view overlooking the valley. This time of the year doesn‚Äôt feature lush green rice paddies as we are already ‚Äúfar‚Äù from the rainy season, and the views are sometimes rather yellow/dry. However we had the best weather the whole time, with fully clear sunny days, with not even one cloud in the sky, and an amazingly dry air, with no humidity at all üòá.

For the night, we booked a cozy cabin in the middle of nowhere, with a beautiful view from the terrace and the possibility to make fire by ourselves.

## **Day 4**
As a first thing in the morning, we visited Ban Rak Thai, a chinese-ethnic village up north where most of the people still speak mandarin, overlooking a nice lake. I have to say the village is pretty, decorated with chinese lanterns everywhere, however it is fully packed with touristic shops, selling any kind of gadget and local product - in particular, this region is know for their excellent tea plants. So overall it was nice but not our favorite place to be üòÖ

After breakfast, we headed to the Lod caves, that you can visit only with a boat tour. Inside the cave there are paintings dated back 2000-3000 years ago, a lot of big fish fed by tourists, and funny cave formations.

After our cave tour, we drove to Pai, where we decided to make a longer stop of 2 nights, in order to take a break from long driving, make laundry, and explore the town of Pai. In the evening we went to eat to the famous Night Market, a long walking street selling any kind of food or souvenirs, bars, restaurants, etc. The choice of food is huge, and we had mostly good food.

## **Day 5**
Being in Pai felt a bit like being in Tel Aviv, as the majority of the people visiting was speaking Hebrew‚Ä¶ In general it is very touristic, with a lot of possibilities to party, ‚Äútipsy tubing‚Äù, etc. So not really our style. But the nature and landscape around Pai is very nice. We visited the Mo Paeng waterfalls, 15 minutes driving out of the center of Pai with the scooter: a little bit packed with people but very nice.

We went again to eat at the Night Market, and we were again not disappointed.

## **Day 6**
We left Pai in the direction of the Mae Sa valley, our last stop before the end of the loop. Actually the loop doesn‚Äôt include this area, but we decided to extend it by one day as we read nice things about this valley. On the way to our destination we stopped for lunch at a Thai restaurant with no english menu. We successfully ordered northern laab, which was very strong but delicious.

In the afternoon we stopped at the Mae Sa waterfalls, where I even dipped quickly in the water.

After this stop, we drove to the Queen Sirkit Botanical Garden, with a huge collection of plants and flowers. These gardens extend on a huge area, that includes a Canopy walkway 20 meters high, and 400m long, on top of a jungle forest. Fabio didn‚Äôt feel like walking on it, but I did it and it was nice, even though the view was not so spectacular. In the late afternoon we reached our guesthouse, a room with a beautiful view on the valley.

## **Day 7**
Unfortunately in the night I had stomach problems, and the plan for the last day was canceled. So we just headed back to Chiang Mai on the fastest possible route, and I had to recover for the next full day.
