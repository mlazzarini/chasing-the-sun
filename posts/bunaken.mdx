We started our - hopefully - long journey in Indonesia with the island of Sulawesi. It is not the most popular indonesian destination, however it is very big: it's ranked the 11th biggest island in the world. It is also known to be a diving and snorkelling beautiful spot, and because of its ancient funeral rituals still performed in the central part of the island.

The first destination was in the northern part, on one smaller island called Bunaken. We slept 5 nights here and we totally loved it. Unfortunately, it was high season, and it was a more popular destination than what we expected, so we had to change our room 3 times because of that. We stayed at <LinkComponent href="https://www.bunakendiving.co/pages/index.php" text="Panorama Dive resort" /> for the first 3 nights, and at the Panorama Backpackers for the last 2. The staff was lovely, always smiling and very welcoming, and the resort and its surroundings were so beautiful that we never moved from this place ðŸ˜… We particularly liked that we could have lunch and dinner together with other guests in the resort, and we could meet very nice people that we really had a good time with ðŸ˜Š I must also mention that most of the guests were germans, and I could keep on practising a bit my language skills ðŸ˜„ Even the food was always very good, and always different.

The best part was the snorkelling, where we could swim very close to so many turtles, corals and any kind of colorful fish. One day we went on the dolphin tour, where we could see dozens of dolphins swimming and jumping in the water. I got so emotional that I started crying ðŸ˜­

In the evening of the indonesian independence day we ended up drinking arak with locals, a spirit made out of palm. We had a fun night - and a headache on the next morning ðŸ¤£
