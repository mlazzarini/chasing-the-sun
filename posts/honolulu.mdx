We flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu, the main city on the Hawaiian island of Oahu. Honolulu is a big city, with high skyscrapers, huge hotels and resorts, and shops of any kind. It is also full of nature and green areas, which makes it a beautiful place, but it's not how you would imagine a small island in the middle of the Pacific Ocean ðŸ˜…

We stayed only one full day, before heading out to Kauai, another Hawaiian island reachable with a 40 minutes flight from Honolulu. We stayed in Waikiki beach, the most popular beach of the city, watching (many!!) surfers catching the waves, and stunning views on the sea. The beach was beautiful, a stretch of white sand, and the sea had some waves but it was still very safe to swim. Unfortunately it was very crowded, so we stayed only a few hours. I have tried to ride the body board, but I'm not sure I really got how it works ðŸ˜…

In the evening we took a Lyft (it's like Uber) and the driver was surprisingly equipped for karaoke inside the car ðŸ˜‚ We drove till Ala Moana Beach, where we could spot a beautiful sunset.
