On the way to Santa Barbara, we stopped in San Simeon to see the elephant seals, that are even bigger and fatter than the sea lions. I'll be honest: they really stink ðŸ˜… -  probably because in this season they change their skin. But it was definitely worth a stop to see them.

Then we spent our last days before Hawaii in Santa Barbara. Santa Barbara is a pretty big and fancy vacation spot, has everything you need in terms of services, shops and beaches. It was pretty expensive as it was the same week of the 4th of July, and we had to sleep in a classic american motel for a quite high price ðŸ™„

Over these days we didn't do many activities or went to tourist attractions, but rather going to the gym and chill at the beach. Now and then we need a few days break from booking hotels, planning the full day, and drive around hours and hours... Vacationing can get hard sometimes ðŸ˜… Over these days we also watched the last Swiss team's football match in the European Championship (in a gym, as it was early morning for us and we didn't have any streaming service available in the motel). Other than that, we went to one of the main beaches close to Santa Barbara downtowm (West Beach), and to Arroyo Burro Beach, where we could spot dolphins swimming and jumping on the horizon of the sea.
