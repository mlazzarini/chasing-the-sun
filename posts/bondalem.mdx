We decided to continue exploring Bali off the most known destinations, to avoid touristic places and influencersâ€™ photo spots. Under suggestion of Ernesto, a friend from Fabioâ€™s family, we stayed at <LinkComponent text="Bali Sandat guesthouse" href="https://bali-sandat.com/" />, owned by Tilly, a swiss woman that moved to Bali for her retirement 15 years ago. Bondalem is a small village with beach and access to the sea: our room was just 2 minutes walking from the beach, immersed in a beautiful green garden full of fruit trees. On our first afternoon we went snorkelling, just starting swimming from the shore. Unfortunately it is not always possible to go inside the water from the beach, only when the tide is high. On low tide the coral is too close to the surface of the sea. However, we were lucky to be there at the right time, and we could explore a lot of colorful small fish swimming between corals in pretty healthy conditions. This was not always possible in Indonesia: for example, in Togean Islands the coral was very damaged, especially by the fish bombing that was still allowed in the sixties.

On our second day, we took a scooter and drove west, towards Sekumpul waterfalls. The entrance was pretty expensive for Indonesia (around 15 dollars/euros each), but it was totally worth it. Maybe the best and biggest waterfalls we have ever seen. We saw 7 of them: some fed by river water, some by ground springs. They are around 100 meters high: in some of them the water falls down with such a power that it creates a very strong wind, and it was almost too cold that go inside (and during the day the temperature was reaching around 35 degreesâ€¦)

On our last day we drove to Tulamben, which is a famous diving & snorkelling site because of a sunk ship is visible a few meters off the shore. It is an american ship which sunk there during the Second World War. We paid a guide to accompany us there (it was not really necessary, as it was pretty clear where the ship was located just looking at dozens of divers and snorkellers in the water ðŸ˜…), and we rented fins (glad we did it as the current was pretty strong). What we saw underwater was quite impressive: a lot of new coral has grown on the surface of the wreck, and there's a lot of colorful fishes swimming around. A part of it is just visible from the surface of the water with a snorkel (and it is not really clear which part of the ship it is ðŸ˜…). However, divers can obviously reach deeper distances, and they can see many more parts of it. We were also lucky to be there when it was low tide, so that we were swimming really close to the wreck.
