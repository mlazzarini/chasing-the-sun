After the tour in the desert, we met again Micha and Nathalia - Fabio‚Äôs friend and his girlfriend - for a couple of days, during which we stayed at <LinkComponent href="https://www.yay-colombia.com/" text="Yay" />, a sustenaible beautiful resort in the middle of the jungle, close to the small village of Guachaca. When I arrived, it felt like I was coming to paradise. We slept in a lovely bamboo hut close to the river, with an open air shower ‚ù§Ô∏è The resort has even a natural pool, that it is directly filled with water by a natural spring. All the food and drinks served in the restaurant - mostly vegan/vegetarian - come from local suppliers or their garden directly. You will not find anything in the room or in the restaurant that is packed with plastic. We loved everything about this place and I admit - it was difficult to leave on the third day ü•≤

During our stay, the weather was very hot. On the second day, we hiked for about 1 hour to a beautiful waterfall and natural pools, and we chilled there for a few hours. We were the only ones there and it felt amazing to dive into fresh water.
