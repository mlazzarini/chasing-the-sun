Chau Doc was a five-hours bus drive from Ben Tre. Bus transportation works very well in Vietnam: we could find and pay the ticket online, and we often had the option to book a "sleeper bus", where every person has a whole couchette to lay down. It was very comfortable and we arrived in Chau Doc on time.

We stayed here 3 nights, our last Vietnamese destination before heading to Cambodia. On the first day, we went to visit the Tra Su forest, and it was amazing. We woke up early to see it when it was not too hot yet, and we were almost alone immersed in the green peaceful nature. We walked around and we hopped on both a paddle boat and a motor boat, to see different rivers flowing through the forest. Afterwards, we visited the temple complex on the Sam Mountain, including the cave inside the temple. It was also very quiet and definitely not a very touristic destination, so we enjoyed a lot the views from there.

On our second day, we went on a boat tour along the river to see some fishermen at work, and the colorful stilt houses on the water. We learnt that living in these houses on the water is cheaper when it comes to taxes. Who can't affort a whole house, lives on a boat, with very challenging living conditions as you can imagine... Overall was a nice trip, and we could chat with our guide about how is life in this part of Vietnam, and some history about the war against Cambodia and the Khmer Rouge, which was particularly hard in these southern areas.
