We decided to spend 10 days in Kauai: the island is not so big and pretty much everything is reachable with the car in 1-2 hours. The first 5 days we slept in Princeville, to visit the north and east shore. We did a lot of beach life, but without any doubt our favorite one was Secret Beach. It is reachable via a 5-10 minute hike from the parking, and both times we visited it, we were almost alone in this beautiful white sanded beach. From the stone wall at the back of the beach, some water flows down, creating some small waterfalls, making it possible to take sort of a natural shower.

One evening we had dinner with a couple of friends from Zurich that were by chance in Kauai at the same time that we were there. We cooked pasta in our rented apartment, that had more than enough space available, and we had a very expensive mango as a dessert. Everything is expensive in Kauai, but this mango was particularly pricey ðŸ˜…. We also met them in secret beach on the following day, before they had to leave the island.

We had fun riding bikes on the East coast, where you can find a bicycle lane that runs along the coast. The weather was not exceptional, as it was a bit cloudy, but it was not raining, so it was a nice way to spend the morning.

We also visited Hanalay Bay beach, and Hideaways beach, that was reachable by walking from our apartment. We wished to hike along the famous Kalalau trail, as it is known as one of the most beautiful trails in the whole Hawaii islands area, but unfortuntely it required a reservation in advance for the parking spot, and we are not planning what to do so much in advance. If there will be another time to visit Hawaii, we will consider to plan more accomodations and activities, as the most beautiful spots require some thinking beforehand.
