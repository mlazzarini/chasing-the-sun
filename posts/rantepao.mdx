We reached Rantepao after a very long drive from Tentena, around 12 hours. However, our driver Nine was excellent company, and at the stops along the way we were asked to take pictures by some local people together with them ðŸ˜… It was pretty exhausting, but we reached our destination at a reasonable time to take a shower and go to bed pretty early.

Rantepao is the biggest center in the Tana Toraja area, that is known to have unique funeral ceremonies and traditions related to death. On the first day, we just went around with the scooter, visiting the local market and the buffalo market. The buffalo is very important in the torajan culture, as it represents wealth: they are pretty expensive, and during the funeral ceremonies, they are sacrified in a quantity that represents the wealth of the family. In this market, the buffalos are tied by the nose so that they cannot sit down, probably in order to show them better, or to make their neck stronger so that they look bigger... Anyway this was already pretty cruel to see for us...

On the second day we were taken to see some stone graves: here the body are placed in holes dug in the wall, together with some belongings or gifts to the dead person. These holes were dug a long time ago, with very rudimental instruments, and they were placed pretty high on the wall so that the belongings could not be stolen. After the body has completely decomposed, the hole can be used again for the future generations, but always belongs to the same family since centuries. We saw also baby graves: these are smaller holes made in big trees' trunks: dead babies and children are placed inside a tree, as they believe their soul can continue to grow together with the tree. After a long time the tree grows and naturally closes the hole, and it is almost not visible anymore. Along the way, we met an old lady selling scarves made out of fibers from pineapple leaves: they dry the leaf and extract very strong fibers that can be used to weave clothes.

Another aspect in the funerary traditions of the torajan people consists in keeping at home the body of the dead person for a period of time that can run months or years. During this time, the family has to gather together and collect money to organize the funeral. Until the ceremony happens, they believe that the spirit of the dead person is still present in the house, so they take care of the dead body by offering him or her 3 meals per day. The body is injected some chemicals that make it not smelling, and the liquids are drained out and discarded. We were invited to see the body of an old lady, dead 3 years ago, who gave birth to 10 children during her lifetime. We could do that in exchange for a gift: 30 duck eggs. It was very impressive to see how her family still takes care of the body, and treats her like she is somehow still there.

On our third day in Rantepao we were invited to a traditional funeral ceremony, on the east side of Rantepao, after a 35 km bumpy drive with our scooter. At first, we sat down together with other guests and we were offered coffee, tea and some sweet snacks. Then we were served lunch: rice, eggs cooked in a spicy sauce, buffalo meat, and pork meat cooked in bambu. After lunch, the procession starts: the coffin of the dead person is carried along a path of 50-100 meters, with sound and loud screams in the background. It is not a procession like we are used to see that in Italy: it gets very muddy... The people is throwing mud at each other, and it is a very joyful moment. At the end, the body is placed on top of a traditional torajan building, and then it starts the part where some singers gather in a circle and start singing about the life story of the dead person. After this phase, they sacrifice animals such as buffalos, pigs, etc... But we left before this started, as it would probably be too much for us to see.
