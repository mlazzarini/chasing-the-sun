Singapore was a less-than-24-hours stay: we landed on a Tuesday early afternoon, and we took off again the next day in the early morning. So we had basically one afternoon and the evening for a quick sightseeing tour. Singapore is a very small independent state, located between Malaysia and Indonesia. It is approximately 10 km X 8 km, and has 5.6 million inhabitants. Most of the population is originally chinese, followed by malaysian and a small percentage of indian.

We visited the famous Supertree Grove gardens, walked along the bay, and took a 40 minutes boat tour on the river. Singapore was a british colony and it is pretty evident from the colonial architecture and the names given to monuments, bridges etc. It became independent in the sixties, after the Second World War, and after that very strict rules were introduced, especially about drugs and weapons. Nowadays they still have death penalty in place for drug related crimes, which sounded quite shocking to us. They are also limiting private cars and traffic by something called COA: it is a certificate that must be paid by every car owner, it is VERY expensive (currently around 70.000 euros), and it expires after 10 years. At the end of this period of time, the car must be scraped or the certificate must be renewed, which means paying again the full amount for a new COA. We learned a lot from Singapore history and interesting facts from a very friendly 75 year old singaporean guy who had a conversation with us while watching the evening light show performed by the Marina Bay hotel - the famous one with the huge terrace deck extended on top of 3 buildings. Learning from the locals is always the best way to discover a new country ðŸ™‚
