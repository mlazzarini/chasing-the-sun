The day after hiking in the Grand Canyon, we had an american breakfast and we started driving in the direction of Vegas. We stopped to have a look at a viewpoint on the Lake Mead, created by the construction of the huge Hoover Dam.

Then we reached our hotel in Las Vegas. The city is crazy. It is just perfectly built to burn money. Everywhere your eye can reach, there is something that you can buy. The famous strip is the portion of the main Boulevard on which you can find the biggest hotels/casinos, such as the Bellagio, Ceasar's Palace, etc. Each one of this hotel looks like a mall, full of shops, restaurants, clubs, and any other sort of entertainment. And the gambling area, of course.

We just played a bit with the slot machines. Someone suggested us to play with the min. 1$ machines (as there are also slot machines for min. 25cent), so that we could get a free drink. Basically, if you spend enough money, you can keep on drinking for free forever, at the price of tipping the waiter.

We also went a couple of times to the Powerhouse Gym Las Vegas, with the best machines - japanese and korean - that we've ver tried. We had a great time in this gym, and we hope we can visit another one, as it is an international chain with branches in the US and all over the world.
