Our first destination after Tokyo was Kyoto, that we reached with the famous Shinkanzen speed train. We thought about stopping at the Fuji mountain, but it is apparently getting more and more complicated to hike on this peak, as you have to reserve a cabin to sleep if you want to get granted access to the hiking trails. Moreover, it was really to hot to go walking, which is normally an activity that we don't miss. However, we could briefly spot the Fuji peak from the train window ðŸ˜….

Kyoto was a very nice city: compared to Tokyo, it is not full of cement and skyscrapers, but more green areas and small buildings. The river passes through the city, making it possible to have a nice walk on the river banks. The atmosphere is in general more relaxed, and we enjoyed our stay a lot. On our first day we went to the famous Fushimi Inari Shrine, where you can walk for a few kilometers through the red torii gates, and on top of the walk you can find a couple of viewpoints on Kyoto city.

We also visited the golden Kinkaku-ji temple, very spectacular but also full of tourists, probably because it is very easy to reach with public transport and not so far away from the center of the city. We liked more the Nanzen-ji temple, with a beautiful classic japanese-style garden, and a small waterfall nearby.

Again, food was a great highlight in Kyoto as well. We had a couple of dinners in "kaiseki" style, which means "fixed menu". Both times we got around 10 small dishes, without prior knowing what was coming: it was great! We had a taste from the japanese fine food cuisine, with beautiful and delicious plates, mostly fish based. But we also went to Nishiki market, where we could taste different kinds of street foods, and see many strange culinary specialities.

On the last day before going to Osaka, we slept in a ryokan (traditional japanese stay) 20 minutes away from Kyoto city center, in Kameoka. It was a beautiful experience, where we could have dinner dressed in a kymono, and visit the local onsen, natural pools with water coming from hot springs. Unfortunately it was too hot to enjoy the warm water, but the surroundings were very beautiful and the atmosphere totally relaxing. We were also served a huge breakfast in the morning, with more than 10 small dishes, always in a japanese style.
