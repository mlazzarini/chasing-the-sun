A travel agency organized the transport to Ko Mak for us. After a couple of taxi rides in Ko Chang, we could finally board a speedboat to the smaller island, and at the pier the staff from our hotel was waiting to pick us up. We booked 2 apartments in a resort in the middle of a thick jungle. We had an apartment right under the roof, and in the early morning the birds on top of our heads were giving a party ðŸ˜… On our first day we rented a scooter, and the roads were definitely smaller and flatter than in Ko Chang. Overall, I would say much easier to drive. Ko Mak is way smaller, and the longest ride that we drove ourselves was maybe 20 minutes.

Right on the first day, we reached Ao Soun Yai beach, that was pretty close to our hotel. We had fresh coconuts and spent there the rest of the afternoon, til the sunset. This beach was also offering many nice photo spots, especially with the red tinted sky at the end of the day.

We went to visit the "famous" Cinnamon Board walk, but it was nothing really special, maybe because the weather was not so inviting to dive in the sea... It is a 500m long boardwalk, that offers also some ladders to go down to the sea. It was a bit cloudy so me and Claudia decided to get ourselves pampered with a massage on the beach. It was awesome (thai massage is strong ðŸ˜…), but later on the sand we got cannibalized by sand flies unfortunately ðŸ˜… The beach was nice though!

In the afternoon we enjoyed the sunset at the Blue pearl bar, a bar located at the end of a wooden boardwalk, in the middle of the sea. The views were amazing... It is possible also to do snorkelling over there, but after a quick look that didn't seem so special, we just had a beer and enjoyed the colors that surrounded us.

On the last day we went to another beach, still pretty close to our hotel, where we could chill on sunbeds with a few bathing in the sea breaks to freshen up ourselves... It was a nice relaxing day, before we travel back to Bangkok, where we said goodbye to Claudia and travelled to the other side of Thailand: the Andaman coast.
