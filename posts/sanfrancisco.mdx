We entered San Francisco with the car in the most spectacular way: driving on the Golden Gate Bridge. Initially we were supposed to stay here 3 days, but then our car had a small problem and we had to extend our stay to 6 days. It was not a problem at all, as we loved the city: there are a lot of public spaces where you can just chill or hang around. The people is very relaxed and the distances in the city are not so long like in LA. We could travel around with public transport the whole time. The homeless people and criminality are an issue, but only in some parts of the city that we just avoided.

On our first day we visited the Golden Gate Park, which is a 4 km long park full of flowers and nice green meadow. We walked then along Haight Street, famous for the alternative thrift shops, and we visited Chinatown. This is the oldest Chinatown in North America, and it really feels to be in a different country üòÖ We also passed by Little Italy, where you can spot the zebras coloured like the italian flag.

On our second day we walked along the shore. Around Fisherman‚Äôs Wharf, we stopped at the Mus√©e M√©canique to play some old time videogames. Then we went to grab lunch at the Ferry Building, an indoor and outdoor space where many food shops and stalls are available.

On our third day we visited Castro, the gay neighborhood, and the Mission district, where Fabio got a nice haircut üòç We stopped at Mission Dolores Park, a very nice park on a hill full of tall palm trees that offers a fantastic view of the city skyline. We came back to this park also on our last day, to see the start of the Trans March. We were in San Francisco right before the weekend of the Gay Pride and the city was full of rainbow-flagged events.

We left San Francisco on a Saturday morning, after watching the football match Italy vs. Switzerland in our motel room at 9 AM in the morning üòÖ On our way to the south, we stopped at the Google Visitor Experience, next to the Google main headquarters, where you can see some android statues around the streets, and some roads named "Google" üòÖ We went also to the Apple Park Visitor Center, and, on my request, we visited the Computer History Museum, that holds a lot of historic pieces of old computers. We could also sit on a first prototype of the Waymo car, a car with autonomous drive developed by Google.
