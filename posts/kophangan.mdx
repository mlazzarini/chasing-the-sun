We travelled from Ko Phayam, on the west coast of Thailand, to Ko Phangan, which is on the east coast, by boat, minivan and then boat (catamaran) again. It was a long journey, that took almost the whole day, and especially the catamaran was a bumpy ride on the sea: it was almost not possible to walk during the journey and a lot of people had to throw up 🫢 Luckily, we didn’t feel sick and finally arrived to our destination in the late afternoon.

For one week we stayed at an apartment very close to the beach, in Ban Tai. The beach there is very short, or when the tide is high, there is almost no beach… But the sea was very calm in this area, and l we used the stand-up paddle board a couple of times to go around. Danny, our Airbnb host, had 3 lovely thai dogs that were coming to say hello from time to time 😊

During this week we didn’t do much other than going to the gym, visiting the Phaeng waterfalls - including the small hike to the viewpoint, and enjoying sunsets from the beach or from a nice bar.

On the 28th of December Fabio’s parents and two friends from Fabio, Mischi and Flo, joined us for 2-3 weeks. We had a villa with an incredible view for the first week all together. The 31st was Fabio’s birthday, and we started the celebrations at home in the afternoon with prosecco and cake. Then we headed for dinner to At Chiang Mai restaurants, one of the best on the whole island for Thai cuisine. Unfortunately Fabio felt sick after dinner, so our plan to go to the Eden bar’s “secret” party was canceled. We headed home with his parents, and waited for midnight’s fireworks, that looked amazing from our house 🤩 Mischi and Flo went to the party though, and in the next days we heard great stories from that night, that was literally described as “heaven and hell at the same time” or also the infamous “affenberg” 😂

The last 5 days Gabi and Rolf (Fabio’s parents) moved to a nice bungalow on the beach, while me, Fabio, Mischi and Flo stayed in a beautiful house with a view on the sea and pool. Over these last days we chilled at our house, visited Fabio’s parents on the beach and nothing special, just relaxing and enjoying Thai food and spectacular sunsets, before saying goodbye to each other. On the last day, me, Fabio and Mischi went together to Ko Samui to fly to our next destination: we travelled to Malaysia, as we had to leave Thailand to renew the visa, while Mischi flew back to Bangkok to catch her flight to Zurich in a few days.
