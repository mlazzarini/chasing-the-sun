The Yosemite National Park is like the Las Vegas of natural parks: you can do everything, from touching the snow, to tubing in the river, from climbing walls, to hiking to beautiful viewpoints. To reach the most-known parts, you have to drive for hours, as this park is so huge - so not exactly the kind of parks that we were used to in Europe ðŸ˜…

But we stayed 4 nights close to one entrance of the park (we would have stayed longer but it is really expensive to sleep here) and we tried to make the best out of our time. We slept in a Yurt - basically a big luxury tent - in the <LinkComponent href="https://www.booking.com/Share-1sDaf3" text="Yosemite Lakes structure" />. In the evening we could light a fire right outside our yurt. It was really beautiful to sleep in this place ðŸ˜Š

We saw the main viewpoint spots: the Valley View, the Bridalveil Falls, the Tunnel View, with sights on the Half Dome and El Capitain. We also drove to the Glacier Point at 2200 metres, from which you can spot amazing views of the Valley.

One day in the area called Hetch Hetchy we hiked to the Wapama Falls: 1000 metres high waterfalls on the artificial lake created by the O'Shaughnessy Dam. The hike was very nice: full of views on the lake, quite easy and 8/9 km long. We had lunch sitting on the big stones close to the waterfall, that sprays a nice cooling breeze.

We visited also Mariposa Grove of Giant Sequoias, that hosts over 500 giant sequoias. The "most famous" trees were the Grizzly Giant and the Tunnel Tree.
