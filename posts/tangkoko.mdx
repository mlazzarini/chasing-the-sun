We arrived in the afternoon in the area of Tangkoko National Park: this park hosts very special animal species, that are present only in this area of Indonesia. Our accomodation was located very close to the entrance of the park, but on the first day we just walked around the village and the beach, that is hosting mainly local fishermen's boats. The people was - as always so far in Indonesia - very welcoming and smiling, a group of kids, speaking pretty good basic english, asked us to take a picture with them ðŸ˜„

On the next day we joined the morning tour in the national park, starting at 6 AM. It was amazing: we could spot a group of black macaques, a kingfisher bird, an owl, a cuscus (sort of ape with a courious face), a lizzard and, after several attempts, a hornbill.

In the evening we went again walking in the park, looking for nocturne animals: the small and cute tarsiers, which are very sensitive to light and can jump for 2 meteres, and some tarantulas hiding in the tree holes.
