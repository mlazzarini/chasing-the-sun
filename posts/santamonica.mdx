After a lot of days during which we were moving fast, we decided to spend a longer period of time in Santa Monica. This was also possible thanks to a couple of friends that hosted us in their apartment while they were not there: thank you so much guys ‚ù§Ô∏è

<BigSpace />

We went a couple of times to Venice Beach: I‚Äôm pretty sure I could spend several hours just looking at the performers on the street, the skateboarders, the rollerbladers, and just even the people around. It is an everyday open-air show üòÖ

We visited also the classic spots: Hollywood boulevard (if you think that having a star on the ground of that road is something exclusive, forget it: this street is so long, that there are even empty stars without a name on it). And downtown LA, where we had a great Thai lunch at the Grand Central Market.

More uncommon things that we did: the stairs in Santa Monica, where the fit american joggers run up and down in a very nice neighborhood that looks like where Hollywood stars live. And thanks to my sweetest colleagues that gifted this to me for my birthday, we could try the stand up paddle for one afternoon. The weather was not the hottest, but we could wear suits and that was perfect. After the first 40 minutes to understand how to paddle, we could stroll around and see from a closer perspective the surfers catching the waves in Malibu beach. After that, we enjoyed a lobster roll (warm brioche bun filled with lobster meat and melted butter on top ü§§) at Broad Street Oyster Company - I think it is on the top 5 of best things that I have ever eaten.

On our last day in Santa Monica, we had a car rented (for 1 month) and we visited the Getty museum, that has an amazing view of the city.
