Every tourist that we met in Sulawesi told us the same thing: getting to the Togean island is a challenge, and now we can confirm it üòÑ After Tangkoko National Park, we reached Manado, the main city in the north of Sulawesi, and after sleeping one night there, we had to drive 10-11 hours with a car to reach Gorontalo, a big port village. From there, we took a night ferry to the island, where we slept first in <LinkComponent href="https://poyalisacottages.com/" text="Poyalisa" />, a nice resort located on its own island üòç The people was absolutely lovely and welcoming, and the manager Riz was always ready to offer us his special cocktail, arak with fruit (a sort of indonesian sangria üòÖ).

One day he took us and another 5 guests of the resort to Una Una island: it was amazing and probably the most remote place we have ever been. What‚Äôs special about this island is the presence of a volcano, that erupted last time in 1983, destroying all the plants, animals and houses. Fortunately the whole population was evacuated to nearby islands, and after 2 years they could come back and rebuild everything from scratch. To reach the crater of the volcano we had first to ride on motorbikes for approximately 1 hour - that was a funny ride, most of it was on the beach‚Ä¶ and then we started our hike up for nearly an hour. We walked along a stream of hot water, that became hotter and hotter the more we were walking up. At the top, we had a spectacular view of geysers sprayed hot water out and creating a sulfurous steam: the view was outstanding. We then visited a bat cave nearby, and walking down rain started pouring heavily, making the way back with the motorbikes even ‚Äúfunnier‚Äù than before üòÑ

Another evening we went fishing with a couple of locals, and I was very surprised that I was able to catch 3-4 quite big fish. We used only a fishing rope with two hooks and sardines to attract the fish. We could then have grilled fish on the boat for dinner.

On our last 3 nights, we moved to a different resort pretty close to Poyalisa. We had a very nice bungalow with beautiful view on the sea. One day we could spot a cuscus on a tree pretty close to our bungalow. We went snorkelling, but the reef was not so spectacular like in Bunaken Island. The highlight of our 5 days stay here was more the romantic sunset view on the sea.
