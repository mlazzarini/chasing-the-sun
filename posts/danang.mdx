We arrived in Da Nang with the night train at 9 AM in the morning. First thing we did was to look for food, and we were immediately satisfied by a super good (and extremely cheap) bun bo soup.

We decided to treat ourselves and we booked an apartment in a pretty luxurious building, but a bit far from the center of the city. The view from our balcony was really outstanding and special.

Being a bit outside of the city, we had to travel a lot with taxis. We mainly used Grab, the “Asian Uber” for both motorbikes and cars, and it is really cheap. While for longer trips we tried to contact and pay directly the drivers, for short trips it was very useful.

The only day we drove by ourselves, we rented a scooter and explore the Son Tra peninsula. It is mandatory to drive a scooter with semi-automatic or manual gears, as the road gets very steep. On the other hand, the views were worth it! We also visited the Lady buddha temple, with the giant female buddha statue.

Another day we decided to visit Ba Na Hills, which is a sort of entertainment park with different kind of attractions available paying extra money, which means not included in the entrance ticket. It was too touristic: in general we didn’t like it and we would not recommend it. We went there mainly to see the Golden bridge, where two giant golden hands hold up the bridge, and this was quite impressive but so full of people that lost a bit its charm 😅. Something really unique about this place is the cable car to reach the park. It takes around 20 minutes and the views over the hills covered in trees and waterfalls are stunning. And I should also mention that the cable car was Swiss made 😄.

We changed then our hotel, to stay closer to the city center. One of the main sightseeing spots of Da Nang is the dragon bridge, spitting fire only at weekends in the evening. Unfortunately when we were there, a storm came exactly in the weekend: we were strongly invited from the hotel staff to just stay inside for one full day, as the wind was really powerful, and all the weather apps were showing warning alerts for the day. So we missed the fire 🙁.

One very cool thing about Da Nang is that it is full of good restaurants. We picked recommendations from the Michelin website: other than giving “stars”, they also have a list of recommended restaurants that are less fancy and pretentious. Some of them are just street food stalls 😅 but all of them really good. Needless to say that the food was delicious. We tried the local “mi quang”, noodles in a beef soup with herbs and beef. Another dish we had multiple times was one plate with pork skewers, herbs and rice papers, where you have to wrap the roll by yourself, and dip it in a peanut sauce.
