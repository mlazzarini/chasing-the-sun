We stayed 4 days in Medellin, and we found it beautiful. It is a very green city, full of parks and huge palms even in the very center of the city. We walked around the city center, and saw some Botero statues in Parque Botero.

On the second day we took a graffiti tour of the Comuna 13 with <LinkComponent href="https://www.instagram.com/walters_toursmedellin/" text="Walter" />, which we really recommend. The history of this area of the city was very difficult, with a lot of violence perpetrated by local gangs and military groups. In 2002, with a 4-days violent operation called Orion, the government military forces used weapons, tanks and helicopters to target members of the militia fighters that were active in the Comuna 13. Since then, the community worked hard to make it a better place, and now it is a colorful, vibrant and touristic area that is safe to visit. The strong hip hop culture has produced graffiti, music, and breakdance artists, and the walls tell the story of the community with strong symbolisms.

We wanted to visit also la Piedra del Pe√±ol in Guatap√® (2 hours drive from Medellin), but unfortunately we both got a bit sick and we had to take it easy during these days ü•≤
