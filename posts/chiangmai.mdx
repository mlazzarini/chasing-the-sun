We landed in Chiang Mai from Kuala Lumpur, and we stayed a few days before starting our journey through the Mae Hong Son loop. During these days, we met Chrigi, a friend from Fabioâ€™s parents that was staying in Chiang Mai since a few weeks, for dinner. We treated ourselves with a massage and we explored the lively area of Nimmanhaemin, with a lot of shops and restaurants. We slept in a guesthouse close to the Gate Night market - which is probably the only streetfood place in Thailand that we would not recommend to visit ðŸ˜… We had a dinner there, and the food was not so good, much below than thai standards.

After riding the loop, we changed our accommodation as the previous one was fully booked, like almost all the accomodations in Chiang Mai on the main booking platforms. Luckily we found a very nice apartment located very close to the previous one. It was good to have a nice place to sleep, as I spent the first day after the loop to recover from sickness (I think food poisoning, but Iâ€™m not sure), and I basically didnâ€™t move from there. In the meantime, Fabio went to a gym and to eat a burger, as he was craving western food after a long time eating only local dishes.

When I was feeling good again, we spent one day exploring the most known temples in the old town of Chiang Mai. We had a temple full immersion day ðŸ˜„ In the evening we had a great dinner at Basik Local Kitchen, a small Michelin recommended place that was fully booked, but luckily we got the only outside table that canâ€™t be reserved ðŸ˜„ We had a delicious grilled bone marrow ðŸ¤¤

On the next day we hiked first to the Wat Pha Lat temple, and then to the famous golden Doi Suthep temple, located on top of a hill in the close surroundings of the city. We both had already visited the Doi Suthep by taxi in the past, so we were more interested in the hike itself than in seeing temples. However, the first temple that we encounter after one hour of walking - Wat Pha Lat - was surprisingly very beautiful. There was a small waterfall at the entrance and the view over Chiang Mai was very impressive. Also the garden inside the temple was very curated and beautiful. The first part of this hike, until here, was pretty flat and easy. Proceeding on the second half, the way became very steep and narrow, but we made on time before the sunset. We basically climbed til the Doi Suthep parking lot, where we could catch a taxi to take us back to our hotel.

Chiang Mai is also famous for its huge night markets. We went both to the Saturday and the Sunday Night market, to stroll around and eat some food. They are really huge, and at this time of the year also very overcrowded. But we enjoyed the food and the colorful stalls selling everything, from clothes, to soap, board games and waffles ðŸ˜„

Overall we enjoyed Chiang Mai a lot. When you walk around the streets of the old town, it feels like a big village rather than one of the biggest city in Thailand. No high skyscrapers, big buildings or wide streets flooded with a lot of traffic. However, right when we left Chiang Mai, so at the beginning of February, the farmers in the north of Thailand start to burn rice fields and the air becomes unbreathable. So we are glad that we visited it over the best time of the year, when the weather is sunny and dry, and the air and the views are not polluted with heavy smoke.
