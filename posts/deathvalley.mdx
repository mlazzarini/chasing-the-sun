After some lazy Vegas life, we hit the road again in the direction of the Death Valley. First, we visited the ghost town of Rhyolite: it was populated in the early 1900s, along with the gold rush. But then the resources were depleted and the population abandoned the town. Today some of the buildings are still standing - or at least partially, such as the old bank and the bottle house: a house built out of 50,000 beer and liquor bottles.

We then drove through the famous Artists Drive, a scenic one-way 15 km route, that winds through multicolored rocks. Fabio was driving at this time, and we enjoyed it a lot.

Afterwards, we went to spot the Mesquite sand dunes, and the Father Crowley overlook, a viewpoint over the Rainbow Canyon, named after the several colors that the volcaninc rock took on because of ancient volcanic activity. This canyon is also named Star Wars canyon: it was used to train military jet pilots, and apparently it is a very challenging flight. A pilot died in 2019, and after that it is not used anymore for military exercises.

We slept in a cabin in the desert, in Panamint Springs, with an amazing view over mountains and stars at night. We enjoyed the Death Valley landscape a lot, but we must admit that during the day the heat was brutal. We could not check the exact temperature as most of the times there is no signal, but probably was above 40 degrees. In general we like to walk, but today was almost not possible. Death Valley is considered one of the most dangerous places on earth, as if you are not careful and run out of water to drink or gasoline for the car, it can get bad very fast, as in most of its territory is basically impossible to find any shadow.
