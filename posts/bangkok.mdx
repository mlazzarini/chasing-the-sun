We flew from Siam Reap to Bangkok with a quick flight, and we stayed for about a week. We built up again our “city-routine”, going to the gym in the morning and just chilling in the rest of the day. We discovered the Muscle Factory gym - this was recommended by a british guy we met in Bali (we don’t remember your name, but thank you, it was a great tip! 👍🏼). It was a really nice gym: we rated it the second best we had in the whole trip.

On one evening we went to watch a Muai thai fight at the Rajadamnern stadium. I was very surprised by how a KO looks like 😅 I was a bit unsure because I thought it is too brutal for me to watch, but in the end we both enjoyed it. And afterwards we went to get a Pad Thai at the famous Michelin recommended Pad Thai Fai Ta Lu... it was delicious!

On another day we went to a Thai cooking class at Silom cooking school. I had the same course 5 years ago, and I really enjoyed it again! We made Tom Yum soup, green curry, papaya salad, pad thai and mango sticky rice. Fabio was the designated “mortar-pounder” when we made together papaya salad 😅

We visited a couple of times the Lumphini park, which is a nice place to breathe fresh air, escaping from the dense pollution of the city, especially hard during rush hours. The park is very nice, and the giant monitor lizards walking around are pretty impressive 😅 We also visited a lot of nice trendy bars and enjoyed many aperos with a coconut... It was very funny to walk around the city, with temperatures around 30-35 degrees, and seeing Christmas decorations all over the place 😅

On the last day in Bangkok, my friend Claudia joined us from Zurich. We took her to see the Wat Pho, with the iconic reclined giant buddha. In the evening we went for dinner to a very nice restaurant: Charmkrung. The restaurant is on the second floor of an old and a bit dilapidated building, but the restaurant itself looks nice and modern, and has a nice view on the city skyline 😅 Both cocktails and food were delicious.
