Driving east, on the way to reach the Grand Canyon, we stopped for lunch at the London Bridge, on Lake Havasu. It was on a Saturday, and the lake was full of boats with loud music and carrying tipsy people. Afterwards, I learnt that the bridge was the actual old bridge from London, that was purchased by the United States from the city of London, and transported here in Arizona...

We slept in a motel close to the South Rim entrance of the Grand Canyon. The following day we hiked the Bright Angel Trail inside the park. The trail goes down the canyon, til reaching the lowest point where Colorado river flows. We could not get to the river, but we stopped at the 3rd mile station, to then turn back and go all the way up to the start of the trail. In the afternoon, we walked more in the park along the South Rim trail, to get some different amazing views on the Canyon.
