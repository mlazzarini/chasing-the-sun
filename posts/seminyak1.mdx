Our trip in Sulawesi was amazing, but after 3 and a half weeks, after more than 1000km travelled by small boats, ferry, fast boat, car, scooter and bus, we were pretty ehausted and needed a break from always being on the way. We decided to settle a bit in Seminyak, letting our days passing by slowly, going to the gym in the morning, and to the beach in the afternoon. We stayed in <LinkComponent href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms/1143827849739666736" text="a super nice Airbnb" />, in a balinese style house, owned by the lovely Lita, sharing the house with 2 friendly big dogs. Lita offered us a delicious Indonesian lunch cooked by her on one day, and we had a funny karaoke session together on another day. She was great and made our time spent in her house very special.

Seminyak is very very touristic. A lot of shops/restaurants/entertainment tailored to tourists, and also a lot of traffic - like in the rest of Bali. However, we must admit that we were happy to eat something different after almost 1 month of eating exclusively Indonesian food ðŸ˜… The beach is wide and clean, with plenty of bars, and the sea is shallow with big waves offshore. We had great views of the sunset, with the sun disappearing behind the horizon line on the sea.

One day we went to Kuta beach, not far from Seminyak: 15 min with the scooter. The beach is similar to Seminyak, but much more narrow, and the waves are a bit smaller there.

We had to renew our visa on arrival in Bali: this meant that we had to drive to the Indonesian Immigration office 3 times. The first time you make the extension request handing off your passport to the office, the second time they take a picture of you together with your fingerprints, and the third time we got the final approval and our passports back. It reminded me a lot of the Italian bureucracy ðŸ˜’ Since our way to the office was pretty long (more than 30 minutes by scooter in the traffic), we decided to extend our trip til Padang Padang beach and the Uluwatu temple. They are both very beautiful per se, but they are extremely overpacked with tourists. In particular the temple has great views on huge cliffs on the sea, but unfortunately one side is spoiled by a construction site that is destoying a cliff ðŸ˜’ Very sad to see.
