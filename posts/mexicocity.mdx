We loved Mexico City. Since the first day we realised we didn't plan enough time here: I'm sure we will come back! On the first day we strolled around in the streets of Centro Historico, the historic centre of the city, eating tacos and drinking Corona.

The following day we visited the Jamaican market, full of colorful flowers stalls but also food. We had the best tacos Carnitas, with slow cooked pork ribs and pork cheek. One butcher wanted to convince us to try the crunchy pork skin, but we didn't dare ðŸ˜‡

However, the highlight of these days was the food tour that we did on the last day. Alejandra from <LinkComponent href="https://mxunderground.com/#" text="Mexico underground" /> took us to a fantastic 11 stops tour, where we could taste the amazing variety and deliciousness of the mexican street food. Most of the dishes were tacos. But we also had _torta de pavo_, which is basically a crunchy sandwich filled with turkey meat and fresh avocado, some extremely sweet and tasty local fruits, one of the best coffee in Mexico, the best _churros_ in town, tacos filled with tongue meat, and even more! Needless to say that we were literally exploding ðŸ˜…

To end on a high note, we took 2 tickets for one of the _lucha libre_ (the mexican famous wrestling) events that took place at the Arena Mexico. The fight looks extremely fake, but the girls and guys on the ring can really jump spectacularly around, and it is a pleasure to watch (and also super funny ðŸ˜‚).
