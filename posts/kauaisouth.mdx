While the north shore looked more like a fancy area, packed with golf fields and luxury resorts, the south seems more ‚Äúrough‚Äù and authentic. But the views and the landscapes were equally beautiful: we can‚Äôt say one part is better than the other. We stayed 5 nights in an apartment with a view on Lawai beach, which is very small but is a pretty popular surf spot, so we could watch surfers and body boarders catching waves almost at any time during the day.

On our first day we hiked along the Mahaulepu Heritage trail, a flat and easy 12km long (round trip) hike with beautful views on the coastline. The trail starts from Shipwreck beach and reaches Haula beach, which is not reachable with a car, making it an isolated spot only for hikers. During our walk, we could meet 2 turtles, kept safe in a sanctuary, and 2 monk seals laying and chilling on the beach. Monk seals are an endangered species, and they should not be approached too close by humans, so it was very special to see them in their wild habitat (and they are so cute! üòç).

On our second day, we drove along the Waimea Canyon drive, on the west part of the island. The drive is around 25 km one way, and has many viewpoint on the Waimea canyon, all reachable with the car or with a very short hike from the parking. At the end of the road, on the highest point, you have a breathtaking view of the western Kauai coastline. Unfortunately the sky was not super clear - but we think it is probably always like this, as the weather on the island is changing very fast, with alternation of rain, clouds, wind and full sun multiple times on the same day. Overall, the weather was very pleasant, not too hot but not too cold, even when swimming in the sea.

On the third day, we visited Polihale State park, which is hands down the best beach that we saw on this part of the island. In the old Hawaiians beliefs, this is the place where souls departed for the afterlife, so it has a spiritual symbolic meaning. The road to get there is long, it took more than 1 hour from our apartment, also because the last 20-30 min driving are on a dirt road. But when you get there, you are rewarded with a super long, white sand beach, with crystal clear water and big waves. Due to the long dirt road, not many people are there, and that makes it even more beautiful and enjoyable. It is possible to camp on the beach, but you need to request a permit a lot more in advance, and the authorities keep only few spots available, which probably contributes to keep the place clean and not overcrowded. We also noticed - but this in general, in the whole Hawaii and California - that, unlike Asia, beaches are always very clean and we could not find plastic or trash (even though whenever you buy food in USA you are almost always given some unnecessary plastic packaging).

One day we had the chance to kayak along the Wailua river. It was an adventure: first to load and unload the kayak from the car, then we hiked through an easy but quite long trail to the Wailua waterfalls. It was a very popular destination, but the views were rewarding the efforts.

During our last day, we visited Poipu beach and Hannecke‚Äôs beach (one next to the other), but only shortly as they were both pretty packed with people. However, we could spot five or six sea turtles swimming very close to the dozens of kids playing and swimming in the water. We decided then to drive to Shipwreck beach, where we could enjoy the nice beach and the big waves (I got scared when one guy was almost falling on me from the top of a huge wave, and that was the end of my swimming for that day üòÇ).

I have to admit it was hard to leave this place. For us europeans Hawaii is a very far destination, but it really looks like a paradise, there is no better word to describe it. Even the weather is nice year around. It is also extremely easy to travel here, as there are plenty of facilities (for example, Polihale state beach park is equipped with showers and toilets for free) and all the main touristic spots are reachable just with the car. However, the prices for almost everything are CRAZY high  - and we are used to Zurich prices‚Ä¶ - so in case you want to visit, be prepared to pay a lot of money, even when you buy stuff in the supermarket.
