We stayed in Cartagena only a couple of nights, but it's true that it is a must-see when you visit colombian caribbean coast. The historical center of the city looks like a spanish old town. It's a pretty colonial city, full of colorful walls and small streets. Unfortunately it is VERY touristic, with a lot of fancy clothes shop and travel agencies. We walked through the cute streets of the city and on the ancient protective walls that surround the city.

Here's some pictures of me, practicing my posing skills through the city.
