Before flying to Vietnam, we spent our last days in Indonesia again in Seminyak. This time we slept at Ernesto's house, a friend from Fabio's family. He moved to Indonesia 30 years ago, and he has a huge garden, full of animals and plants and trees. Unfortunately he was not in Bali when we were there, but he kindly let us stay in a guesthouse inside his property. It was so nice to wake up in the morning immersed in any kind of animal sound... He has gooses, ducks, a peacock, chickens, cats and 9 dogs running around the garden. Fabio became close friend with Caro and Luna, two big black lovely Labradors that liked very much to be pet and cuddled all the time.

Other than enjoying a few more beach sunsets, we had also a couple of bad days because of an accident with our credit cards: both of them were cloned, probably after withdrawing cash from ATMs. 3500 swiss francs (more than 4000 US dollars) were taken out of our account, and we had the chance to spend some time with the friendly police men from Kuta's police station. Luckily the credit card refunded us, but It was an experience we hope not to repeat.
