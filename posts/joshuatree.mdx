On our way to Grand Canyon, we decided to visit the Joshua Tree National Park, which sits in the desert area in the south-west of California. It's crazy how the landscape changes completely driving from the coast: after not even a few hours of driving, the desert starts and the weather gets very hot and dry. So the park is a "desert" park ðŸ˜„ But the landscape is very special, and it's definitely worth a visit.

And yes, we have a huge Jeep (because Fabio wanted it). He says we need it...
