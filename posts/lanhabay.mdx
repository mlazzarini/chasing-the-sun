Normally we avoid very touristic spots and activities, but we wanted to enjoy the landscape from the area of Halong Bay, so we made an exception. We booked a 3-days/2-nights cruise to sleep at this bay area with beautiful views. We chose one of the smallest boats we could find, to avoid ending in a big group of tourists, and it was actually a good idea: our boat had 16 cabins in total, and was not too packed. The ship's journey went from Halong to Lan Ha Bay, stopping in Cat Ba Island on the second day.

The first day we were driven with some other passengers from Hanoi to Halong. Halong is a big touristic destination, especially for Vietnamese and Chinese people, who prefer to sleep on land rather than on the many boats that drive around the bay. We had lunch on the cruise as the first thing, and then the dozens of activities started: we were taken first to see a cave, and afterwards to swim in the waters of the bay (we skipped this). Unfortunately, all these cruises come with a bunch of activities, some skippable and some not. We don't like to do things rushing so much, so we skipped as many as we could...

In the evening we had a lesson about how to make a spring roll, then dinner on the deck of the cruise. Yet again: we skipped the karaoke and the fishing scheduled for after dinner ðŸ˜…

On the second day our boat had to return on land to leave passengers that chose the 1-night cruise option, so we were taken to another smaller boat to enjoy the planned activities with passengers from other boats. Unfortunately for us, this boat was much more packed and we could return to our ship only in the afternoon (which means non-skippable activities ðŸ¥²)... However, we enjoyed a bike ride on Cat Ba island (not too scenic but okay), visiting a "local village" (nothing really authentic), and after lunch we had a short kayak session. We returned then to our bigger boat and enjoyed again the dinner on the deck. The food was overall good, but they served us many elaborate plates, in small quantities, and the plates were more or less a fusion of western and Vietnamese kitchen. We like a lot Vietnamese food, and we don't miss western dishes at all... So we would have preferred classic Vietnamese meals, but it was okay anyway.

It was very funny how we were approached by some women or men on a small boat that wanted to sell us drinks/snacks while we were in our cabin ðŸ˜„ They drive close to the big ships, sometimes even paddling themselves, and scream and gesticolate to try to sell their merchandise.

On the last day it was raining, so we spent the morning enjoying the rainy view of the sea from our cabin with balcony. We had one last meal on the boat, then we headed in the direction of our next destination: Ninh Binh.
