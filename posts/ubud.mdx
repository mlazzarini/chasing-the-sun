After a chilling break in Seminyak, we decided to move to Ubud. We heard that it would be a touristic destination, so we slept in an airbnb in the middle of rice fields, 20 minutes north from the center of Ubud, on the way to the small town of Tegalalang. The location was amazing, and it was so nice to wake up in the morning and have breakfast with a green view on rice fields, in such a quiet and beautiful place.

On our first full day there, the weather was pretty cloudy, so we decided to walk along the Campuhan Ridge Walk, a short 20 min hike on hills immersed in the nature. The walk is well paved and very easy, but still worth to do. We had lunch in a restaurant located at the beginning of our hike, with a nice view.

In our second day, we squeezed in a lot of activities, such as visiting the Ubud Palace, walking in the local market, an easy hike between Tegalalang rice terraces, entering the water temple Pura Tirta Empul and a degustation of local coffees and teas. The most impressive was definitely the Tegalalang rice terraces: quite touristic, for example there were a lot of swings where girls can take a picture with a long red dress provided there, and drink stalls every 10 meters... So the place lost a bit its authenticity, but it is still stunningly beautiful. What was really disappointing was seeing so many foreigners practising the purification ritual in the Pura Tirta Empul temple. The temple pond has a spring giving out fresh water regularly, which Balinese Hindus consider to be holy. The ritual consist in entering the pond and wet your head with water coming out of the fountains. There was a huge queue of people waiting for getting in the water, all foreigners, ready to take a picture of themselves with their phone. It is very sad that the local people let tourist spoil such a holy place: in my opinion, the temple can be visited but the ritual should be limited to Balinese Hindus.

On the last day we visited the Kampo Lanto waterfall, which would be very beautiful, if it was not horribly full of people waiting on a queue to take "sexy pictures" with the waterfall background. Honestly, we stayed very short there because of this. Ubud would really be a beautiful destination, full of nature, so much green everywhere, amazing temples and spiritual vibes. In the past it was a small town full of artists, now it is really really spoiled by mainstream tourism, where influencers queue for the best shot to post on their instagram feed... It was nice to see it, but I'm not sure we would come back if we happen to be in Bali again.
