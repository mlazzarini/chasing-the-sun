We stayed 4 nights in the misty area around Minca. The first 2 nights in a house located at an altitude of 1600mt, in an area named Vista Nieve. The view from the cozy house was incredible, and we just spent one full lazy day inside the house, cooking and chillin, together with Micha and Natalia, with the rain pouring outside.

On the 3rd day just me and Fabio stayed another 2 nights in the center of Minca, in a nice hotel that provides accomodation in bamboo huts immersed in the greenery of the jungle. During the second day, we had a nice hike to the Marinka waterfalls - with a way back very full of rain (it was honestly fun!).

I found Minca a lovely green place to cool down from the heat. However I must say that I was a bit disappointed by the spiritual tourism. A lot of americans and europeans come to Minca with the only purpose of participating in rituals that are part of the indigenous population culture, like Ayuhasca, and I find it a form of pretty arrogant cultural appropriation. Many bars expose advertisement like this, with several options: from Kambo ceremony (injection of frog poison in the body for healing and cleansing purposes), to mushrooms, etc..
