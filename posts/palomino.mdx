We arrived in palomino last Sunday at lunchtime, after a heavy rain storm happened on Saturday. The water and electricity in our house was not working (often happens after storms, it is quite common in this area), and walking around in Palomino a lot of streets were flooded with mud, so it was not love at first sight 😁

However, it got better the second and third day. Palomino is considered a hippies/backpackers destination, and indeed it is. The atmosphere is very chill, and everyone is friendly and smiling. We did long walks on the beach and enjoyed food in the many nice restaurants you can find around.

Here's a picture of a typical colombian pre-breakfast: el caldo. Reminded me of a vacation a few years back in Madrid 😇 It is a piece of meat in broth with vegetables, with other spices and flavors. Strange to drink broth for breakfast, but the taste is very good - and I think it somehow cools you down from the humid heat that is present at this time in this area 🥵
