Hoi An is pretty close to our previous destination Da Nang, and not so big. It was less than one hour driving, so we could possibly visit it one day instead of sleeping there, but it was a nice place to be, and I wanted to buy some custom clothes, for which Hoi An is famous. So this requires at least 2-3 days for fitting and adjustments.

Hoi An’s center is easily walkable and very pretty. That’s why is very packed with tourists. We walked around the most popular streets and spots, like the Japanese covered bridge. There are also many nice cafes where you can just sit, sip a drink and watch hectic life on the river or in the small streets.

The local food speciality is cau lau, a meaty noodle soup with pork, vegetables and deep fried crackers. Regarding sweets, we could try the “mango cake”, which is not a cake and doesn’t have any mango in it 😅. It’s a rice dumpling filled with nuts and brown sugar… it was delicious!

The days that we were in Hoi An were pretty rainy, but we knew it as the central part of Vietnam has still a lot of rain during this time of the year. That’s why we decided to head directly to Ho Chi Min City instead of descending the country more slowly with the train, which was our original idea in case the weather would be not too bad.
