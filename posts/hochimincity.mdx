We flew to Saigon with a quick and cheap flight. We stayed 7 nights in two different Airbnbs, both were apartments in the most central part of the city: district 1, and it was perfect!

We decided to dive immediately in the local food culture with a food tour by Xoxo tours. We went around on the back of scooters driven perfectly by young girls. It was very nice as they took us to districts that are normally not visited by tourists, like the chinese or the expat district. It was a bit sad and surprising to see many empty apartments in the expat district: after Vietnam's economy has opened up to global investments, a lot of Vietnamese people instead of keeping money in their bank account, invested in properties. But most of the people living in the country can't affort to buy one of these apartments, so many are sadly empty. We kicked off the tour with a delicious fish/crab soup, then we went to a barbecue restaurant where we were served goat and other kind of meat. The third and last stop was a seafood restaurant where we had scallops, crab meat and some desserts.

In the following days we explored the city and the most known touristic spots like the main post office, with a big portrait of Ho Chi Min, and the People's Committee building. From our second Airbnb we had a view on the Bitexco Financial Tower, one of the tallest buildings in Vietnam. We visited the observation deck which is on the 52nd floor, needless to say that the view is great.

We went also to the War Remnants Museum: very impressive the original war planes and tanks in the courtyard of the museum, and the hundreds of stories and pictures about the damage caused by the use of napalm and Agent Orange. They have caused horrible various deformations and health problems to the people, that are still visible today in the generations born after the war.

If I had to pick one thing that was really special in Ho Chi Min City, I would say the cafes and bars. One great example is the famous “cafè apartments”: a building whose apartments host cafes, with their own sign outside on the balcony 😄. We even had one cafe on the same floor of our second Airbnb, on the 7th floor. And the weirdest thing about these big Saigon’s house buildings is that the stairs generally look terrible, very old and dirty… Then entering the apartments is like entering in a different universe: smelling perfect, sparking clean and looking nice 😄

We also found a couple of rooftop bars with stunning views on the city, where we spent a couple of evenings. We particularly liked Lefe’s bar, with the view on the noisy Bui Vien Street, that during the weekends becomes a tacky party spot with loud bars and dancers on the tables. The entrance is hidden, as the bar lies on the top floor of a hotel 😅. To reach the bar, you must enter the hotel, declare to the reception that you are going to Lefe’s, and take the lift to the last floor. Another one was Mary Jane's, as hidden as the other one 😄

I thought I could extend my visa on arrival to stay longer in Vietnam, but unfortunately this was not possible. I would have had to fly out of the country and come back… not worth it. So we decided to spend the last 5 days in Vietnam in the Mekong delta area, and then cross the border with Cambodia with a boat from there. So we headed to Ben Tre with a very comfortable mini van ride.
