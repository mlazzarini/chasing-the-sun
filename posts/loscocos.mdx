We had the chance to stay 6 nights in the <LinkComponent href="https://www.airbnb.co.in/rooms/1010927194362513615" text="beautiful house" /> handled by Micha - Fabio's friend - located in Playa Los Cocos. The location is amazingly direct on the beach. Falling asleep and waking up with the waves sound was great.

Fabio and Micha are friends since a long time. He is originally swiss, but living in Colombia since 5 years, working together with the local communities to improve the area around, which has a past of violence through different military groups that competed for power over this region. During our stay, Micha, together with his girlfriend Natalia, took us to visit his land he bought in the middle of the jungle. He's growing A LOT of different kinds of plants (coffee, mangoes, avocados, bananas are only a few), but always respecting the land, and learning from the local people information and techniques about the local vegetation. For example, the house on the beach was built using exclusively wood from already fallen trees.

During these days we also visited Tayrona Natural Park, where we could see a lot of different wild animals that you would normally see only on documentaries. The biodiversity inside this park is amazing, and following a well signposted route, we could reach the beach, Playa Cabo San Juan, that is an incredibly beautiful caribbean beach, with white sand and clear light blue water.
