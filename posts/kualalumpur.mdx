We picked Kuala Lumpur as our next destination as we wanted to see something that we both have never seen, so Malaysia there we go ðŸ˜Š We were also influenced by Bizhu, that we met in Bangkok in August. Back then we went for dinner at Haawm, a known American-Thai chef that cooks at his place and serves dinner at a communal table. There we had the chance to talk to other guests, and she recommended to visit Malaysia. So we contacted her and she provided a list of suggestions for us. We even met her for a quick breakfast at Nim Nim, where we had an amazing Pan Mee: handmade egg noodles served with minced meat, an egg and a lot of spices and herbs. This dish is originally chinese, as we found out that Malaysia is a big multicultural country, with influences from China, India, Indonesia and other countries.

Unfortunately when we arrived the weather was rainy, but then we had a couple of grey dry days, so it was not bad. On the first day, we went to visit the Ilham Gallery, that was hosting an exhibition about punk culture in the 90s. After that, we checked out the big area of the Botanic Garden, a lot of green in the heart of the city. In general, we found Kuala Lumpur very "green": a lot of trees and plants, even though it is a very developed city, with a lot of skyscrapers and high buildings.

On our second day, we visited the REXKL, a library and cultural center, with a huge and extensive collection of books to choose from. It is very close to Petaling street, with very packed market stalls selling any kind of gadget, clothing or food. We went then to the Zhongstan building, an art center, with shops and a bar, in a neighborhood with a lot of street art around.

Overall we enjoyed very much our stay. We had both the idea of Malaysia as a strict muslim country, but we were surprised with a lot of different ethnic groups mixed together and a lot of different asian subcultures. It is also a very modern city, with big malls (like the Petronas towers), but also a lot of parks and public space available.
