On the 14th we woke up early, had a breakfast from a very good street food stall selling "bo nÃ¨" close to the pier, and boarded our boat in the direction to Cambodia. The boat was very packed and pretty warm inside, so most of the time we sneaked out to sit on the floor and enjoy some air ðŸ˜„. This boat was expensive for Vietnamese standards, so it was kind of expected that it was full of tourists only. However, we had a smooth experience crossing the border with Cambodia: the staff of the boat arranged everything for us, and we just had to wait a couple of hours overall.

Arriving in Phnom Penh, we realised that we ended up to be in the middle of the Water Festival days: a national celebration where teams of rowers compete on the river during the day, and the streets are flooded with food stalls and people wandering around the city. Our hotel had the perfect view on the river: we could watch the colorful boats directly from our balcony.

We stayed only one full day in Phnom Penh: we went to a gym, tried some local food, and wandered around the streets, with a lot of music playing from every corner, and flooded with people coming from all over the country.
