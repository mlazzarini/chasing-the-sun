We arrived in Ko Phra Thong after one speedboat ride, 2 hours bus ride and a 1 hour longtail boat ride. We didnâ€™t know what to expect, as both of us have never been there before, and the island, despite being pretty close to the mainland, is very remote, as there are no roads or supermarkets. There are only a few resorts and guesthouses, where you can buy food and drinks. We stayed in a very nice resort on the beach, with new wooden bungalows built on stilts on the water. We were surprised by the quality of the accomodation and service that we found here: we were expecting much simpler options available on this island.

We spent the first day just walking along the endless stretch of beach, starting from our resort. Overall this beach, basically the only one on the island, is more than 10 km long. We even had to cross a small section of the beach that was flooded with water, by pulling ourselves on a platform. It was very hot, and we decided to stop at the last resort we saw after walking 3-4km to drink something. This resort was also looking very nice and fancy, and we had the chance to talk to the owner that was there around. She told us <LinkComponent href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt28618089/" text="a German movie" /> "A Million Minutes" was shot on the island, and that the island was also hit by the tsunami in 2004. She also told us that the resorts on this island cannot have swimming pools as they don't have enough water, and most of their electrical energy is supplied by solar panels. Our resort had also a zero-plastic policy, and they were refilling our water bottles anytime we asked.

On our second day, we attempted a walk to the middle of the island. Ko Phra Thong has a unique inland landscape that resembles african savanna, and we were curious to see it. Unfortunately it was too hot to walk, and we didn't have enough water with us, so we had to walk back and stopped for lunch at a Thai guesthouse nearby our accomodation. In the afternoon we took the kayak from our resort to a small nearby island, with only a small beach and some forest. It was a very short ride, but it was cool to be the only ones on a very small island ðŸ˜„.

Overall, we liked very much the landscapes on Ko Phra Thong, and the fact that it is not overdeveloped with a lot of resorts packing the beach. However, it is a very sleepy place, with a lot of people looking for peace and tranquility. The lack of streets on the island makes it also difficult to explore, and you mostly end up staying the whole time at the same place, even though the island itself is pretty big.
