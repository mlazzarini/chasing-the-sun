Ninh Binh was once the capital of Vietnam, and it is located 2 hours driving south from Hanoi. It doesn't really have a big center - or maybe we could not find it 😄 We stayed in an area close to Trang An, where the most beautiful views are. Other areas that we visited are the touristic and packed Tam Coc, and the "downtown" area, where we went to a gym.

We chose an Airbnb that was in a quiet place, with a nice view from our own bungalow in the nature.

I had recommendations from Mihn Kahn, one of my ex colleagues, who was so nice during our whole stay in Vietnam to give us a lot of good tips. We did a boat tour in Trang An on the river, where we could admire the big limestone rocks from the water. We learnt that here in this area a King Kong movie was filmed 😄 The route that we chose included also visiting some caves that we could explore from the boat... It was very nice! And luckily not with many tourists.

We visited the Bai Dinh Pagoda - it was not even mentioned in our travel book guide, but it is a huge temple area built recently, whose surface covers kilometers and you can walk forever. It was very impressive, and it was not flooded with tourists.

On one afternoon we could walk up for 45 minutes at the Mua Cave Viewpoint, to have an amazing view over the area. One of the best views we've ever had, but unfortunately it was so packed, that it was almost dangerous to stay at the small deck at the top. So after taking some pictures we quickly went down again.

On our last day we had a delicious dinner in Tam Coc, with roasted duck and pork in caramel sauce... Amazing food in this restaurant called <LinkComponent href="https://g.co/kgs/ZCgMsZi" text='"Family restaurant"' />. Another night we were invited to have dinner with the family and friends from our accomodation's owner. It was very funny and we had the chance to try a (very very small) bite of goat blood... It lookes like a red gelatine, and tastes a lot like... well, goat 😄. Not our favourite dish, but never try never know 😄. And Fabio (curiously only him) was invited many times to make a toast to the Vietnamese women's day (20th October): funny how no women were invited to drink alcohol, as they were all working in the kitchen 😅. He had many shots of palm wine, but the next day he was incredibly fresh again 👍

After Ninh Binh, our next stop is in the central part of Vietnam: Da Nang. We decided to take the train to get there, and it was a fun 14 hours drive with local people 😄 While we were waiting for the train at the Ninh Binh station, we saw a father taking around his two kids of about 8-10 years old, to go to speak to tourists in order to improve their English. I even spoke to one kid for 10-15 minutes, and I found it so sweet! It doesn't cost anything to anyone, and it is very important for Vietnamese people to learn English, to have better job opportunities. Many Vietnamese - who can afford it - send kids to extra English lessons for this reason.
