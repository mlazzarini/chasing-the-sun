The Ha Giang loop is a 350km route through amazing views with green limestones rocks and rice fields. It is possible to experience the loop with ‚Äúeasyriders‚Äù (the local motorbike taxis), but we decided to drive ourselves because we wanted to be more flexible on stopping and driving times. And we are so glad we did it like this‚Ä¶ Very big group of young and ‚Äúthirsty‚Äù tourists travel through the loop with these riders, flooding small cafes, restaurants and accommodations. We were unfortunately in one of those hotels and the karaoke in the evening after dinner was not a pleasure. However, most of the times we were almost alone and immersed in beautiful nature, so we would definitely recommend this trip.

We completed the loop in 3.5 days, sleeping 3 nights along the route. We drove in the direction which is most uncommon, to avoid as much as possible any traffic. The first stop was Du Gia: a few hours drive from our starting point Ha Giang. The views along the way were amazing, we stopped so many times only to take pictures. We slept in a <LinkComponent text="cozy cabin with a view of the mountains" href="https://www.booking.com/Share-HENTZ8" />.

The second day we arrived to Dong Van, driving through Meo Vac. This was probably the most spectacular part of the loop, with the views on the Ma Pi Leng pass: green hills that tumble down to the emerald green waters of the Nho Que River. We slept in a <LinkComponent href="https://www.booking.com/Share-ChR4ox" text="very cozy room with a balcony" /> in Dong Van: we had dinner at this homestay with a great hot pot (where you can cook food on your own), and we enjoyed the company of the pets wandering around.

On the third day we woke up early and decided to hike the Sky Path, an easy ridge walk with amazing views of the Ma Pi Leng pass, so we had to drive 20 minutes back along the loop from our homestay. After lunch we reached the northest village of Lung Cu, almost at the border with China, and then we made our way south to sleep in Yen Minh. This was probably the less beautiful day, as we met many big groups of people both on the way in the afternoon and in our homestay in the evening. However, during the hike in the morning we were almost the only ones üòÑ.

On the last day we drove back to Ha Giang and on the next day we took a bus back to Hanoi.
